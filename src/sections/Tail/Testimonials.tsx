        "You are indeed a ray of light! 1 hr with you has been very enlightening. I was stuck in a loop for many months about what the next steps should be for my business, you guided me to the answers BEAUTIFULLY! I am truly mind blown with your mastery with coaching and how well the session was done. Your polite, kind and friendly approach made the session very enjoyable. The way you patiently listened, the attention given to every word I spoke, makes me feel heard and valued. I truly truly enjoyed time with you. You pulled me out of the quick-sand I was stuck in for many many months. You are very skillful and knowledgeable. May all your lives wishes come to fruition. Hope many others get empowering sessions from you and may Noor's light shine through.",

        "This is my first experience with a life coach was quite significant. I genuinely felt how important it is to engage with someone who seeks to understand you and assist in your self-discovery. I had always sought solutions from the external world or other people, often neglecting to focus on myself. Although the number of sessions was limited, they played a significant role in helping me understand who I am and the goals I intend to achieve. This is the reality, and truth be told, it might be something ordinary. There were only a few sessions, and they came to an end. However, for me, they occurred at a time when I was feeling lost and depressed, in need of a genuine push. Thanks to God and, indeed, thanks to you, I persisted with them, and I became someone who explores their inner self.",
